**An Application to track user activity and regulate the tasks accordingly.**

## Tech Stack Used

- React Js
- Material UI
- Charts JS
- Context Provider

## Possible Improvents

### Project

- REDUX can be used to enhance scalability.
- Currently, we are using three different components for Screen time, Devices and Usage. This can be implemented using a single component by passing different props.
- Figma Wireframe Guide are not strictly followed, can be implemented for better UI.
- In case of large data set for Charts.JS, we can use optimisation techniques like Lazy-Loading.

### Performance

- First Contentful Paint(FSC) is 1.7s. It can be improved by using CDN, caching, reducing your DOM size, hosting the fonts locally, and eliminating render-blocking resources.
- Total Blocking Time(TBT) is 490ms. Following practices are used to reduce TBT.
  - Reduce the impact of third-party code
  - Reduce JavaScript execution time
  - Minimize main thread work
  - Keep request counts low and transfer sizes small

## Style Guide

### Component definition

All components (presentation, containers or pages) are
defined as a directory, named with pascal casing. The main component file
should be `index.js`, main stylesheet `style.css`. CSS custom properties
can be kept in `properties.css`:

```
AwesomeCard/
├── index.js
├── properties.css
└── style.css
```

---

### Project organization

The project components are separated in at least three directories:

```
awesome-react-project/
└── src/
   ├── components/
   ├── containers/
   └── pages/
```

Each of these directories have special types of components:

#### `components/`

Stateless components. Shouldn't store state. Most components in this
directory will be function-based components. Stuff like buttons, inputs,
labels and all presentational components goes here. This components can
also accept functions as props and dispatch events, but no state should
be held inside.

#### `containers/`

Container components can store state. Containers are built mostly from
the composition of presentational components with some styles to layout
them together. Containers can also store internal state and access refs
to provide additional logic, but all actions should be accepted as
component callbacks.

#### `pages/`

Page components can store state, receive route parameters and dispatch
Redux actions when applicable. Pages are the highest level of application's
components. They represent the application routes and most times are
displayed by a router. Pages are also responsible for handling container
components callbacks and flowing data into children containers.
